## Game Description

In the future, a massive space station suffers a disaster. You play as a scientist whose ship crashes into the station. Once, you were studying alien life, but now those creatures have escaped and turned hostile. The station is crawling with enemies, and your job is to clear it room by room until you reach the final boss in the most important chamber.Each room is a new level, with layouts, enemies, and obstacles that change every time you play. Some enemies rush you, others hide and hunt, and bosses use smart tactics like cover and movement to make battles more intense. This makes combat is fast and dynamic. Bullets can bounce, weapons feel powerful, and the environment panels can break and turn off gravity, air can leak into space, and gas can spread through the station. You can swing on ropes, dash to dodge attacks, or even use explosions to launch yourself across the arena.The story is told through items you find, letting you uncover what really happened on the station as you fight to survive.

## Advanced Topic Description

### Procedural Generation

Levels are built as a sequence of procedurally generated rooms. Each room has a fixed size but changes in layout, enemy placement, and obstacles. Rewards differ from room to room. Boss rooms are also procedurally generated but designed with unique mechanics (cover, different physics,  adaptive AI, which hunts the player). Environmental specifications such as broken panels, zero gravity are going to be added into the generation system so hazards feel dynamic and tied to the theme of the space station.
    
### Physics: 


Players can swing on ropes, dash, and use explosives. Bullets will have potential ricochets. Environmental destruction impacts gameplay (mob breaking panels can disable gravity) puncturing walls can vent air, and gases will spread through the station using fluid dynamics.


## Midterm Goals

* Procedural generation done far enough to be able to create a whole level. Rooms should have a general outline. Basic weapons should be decided on for both mobs and players. Weapons should have progression. The next room should have different rewards. 
* Basic enemy movement, regular mobs should have basic ideas of combat and be able to fight back and interact with the player. Stick figures for mobs should be completed. Basic prototypes for mobsâ€™ sprites should be completed.

...

## Final Goals

* 45%: Rooms should be structured and put in order. Levels should have a logical continuation. 
* 45%: All rooms should be finished and put in order. The game should be gracefully concluded.
* 10%: Sound effects should be made. Potentially background music might be added

...

## Stretch Goals

* Add a unique Reaper mob that will chase the player with unique AI if they spend too long 
  clearing the level
* more unique weapons (physics elements on a weapon, weapons that have unique 
  interactions with the enemies / environment)
