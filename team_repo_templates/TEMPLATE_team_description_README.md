## Midterm Goals

* Procedural generation done far enough to be able to create a whole level. Rooms should have a general outline. Basic weapons should be decided on for both mobs and players. Weapons should have progression. The next room should have different rewards. 
* basic enemy movement, regular mobs should have basic ideas of combat and be able to fight back and interact with the player. Stick figures for mobs should be completed. Basic prototypes for mobsâ€™ sprites should be completed.

...

## Final Goals

* XX%: Rooms should be structured and put in order. Levels should have a logical continuation. 
* XX%: Sound effects should be made. Potential background music
* XX%: All rooms should be finished and put in order. The game should be gracefully concluded.

...

## Stretch Goals

* Add a unique Reaper mob that will chase the player with unique AI if they spend too long 
  clearing the level
* more unique weapons (physics elements on a weapon, weapons that have unique 
  interactions with the enemies / environment)
